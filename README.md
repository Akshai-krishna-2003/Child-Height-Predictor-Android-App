## Description

## App usage 
I have provided the APK file of the app in my repository. Just download that and install it on your android device.

## How to Use

1. Enter the child's age, gender, father's height, and mother's height in the input fields.
2. Select the unit system (metric or imperial) for height measurement.
3. Click the "Predict!" button to calculate the child's predicted height.
4. The predicted height will be displayed below the button.

## Formula used in this application
### Khamis-Roche Formula

The Khamis-Roche method is a widely used formula for predicting a child's height based on their current age and parental height. It is commonly used by healthcare professionals to estimate the child's future growth. The formula is given by:
<kbd>
**PAH = Current Height + (K * (MPH - Current Height))**
</kbd>
Where:
- PAH: Predicted Adult Height
- Current Height: The child's current height
- K: The growth constant, which varies depending on the child's age and gender
- MPH: The mid-parental height, which is calculated as (Father's Height + Mother's Height) / 2

## Compatibility
- Android: API level 21 and above
